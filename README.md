This project will need 2 microcontrollers. The ones i used were an Arduino R3 Uno and ESP8266. 
In order for the simulation to work with the code found in .ino you need an extra app to simulate communication between COM ports virtualy.
This solution can be found on the internet by searching for "virtual serial port driver" or similar terms.
